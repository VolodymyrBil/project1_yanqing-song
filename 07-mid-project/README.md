Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset (heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv) is taken from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data were collected during 2015. It contains the medical records of 299 patients with previous heart failures. Each patient profile has 13 clinical features regarding clinical, body, and lifestyle information in this dataset. The goal is to build a model that predicts death events of patients,  i.e. whether the patient died before the end of the follow-up period. For this binary classification problem, logistic regression, random forest, and xgboost model have been used. The final model (train.py,  model.bin) was trained using random forest model and served locally via flask, gunicorn. `pipenv` was used to manage dependencies. `Dockerfile` was used for running the container service.
